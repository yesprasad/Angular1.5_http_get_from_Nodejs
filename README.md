# Angular1.5_http_get_from_Nodejs

This code sample makes a get request to nodejs application that uses express to get json data and display it to the users.

This is a good sample to start working and a good sample that helps understand how to make use of $http to make calls to a server 
and get data to bind it to the angularjs page.

The Nodejs sample in this application will also help you on how to write the tiny yet importan Expressjs route that helps get rid of 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' error.
